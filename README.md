# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Understand the data distribution, missing values, relationships between variables, and draw meaningful insights using visualization.

## Dataset
[Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset
2. Checked for missing values and handled them
3. Explored data using statistics and visualizations
4. Created histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps
5. Made basic feature-level inferences

## Key Insights
- Women and children had higher survival rates.
- Passengers from higher classes (Pclass = 1) had better chances.
- 'Cabin' had many missing values and was excluded.
- Fare and survival had a weak positive correlation.

## How to Run
- Clone the repo
- Open `titanic_eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
- Make sure `train.csv` is in the same directory
